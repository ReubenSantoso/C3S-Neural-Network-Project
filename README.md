# Ongoing: Graph Structure Construction for GNNs
SVR model combinations from our datasets have been exhausted with minimal improvements to reach below 1.6% MSE rate. Now trying graph representations with appropriate edge definitions and node features.

Attempting: 

1. Edges as fingerprints strucuture for message passing using 5 nearest neighbours

2. Future: VAEs
